# Discord-Sings

This bot has a unique idea and probably no one has ever done it.

env file should have the following
```
TOKEN=bot token here
PREFIX=;;
LYRICSAPI=genius api key here
```

Bot is almost complete, just need to add a help command but i dont have the motivation to complete and host it. (Mostly because of the need to add slash cmds)
You can use the code here and host it by yourself. Please make sure to credit me!
